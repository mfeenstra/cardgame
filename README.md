Ruby Coding Challenge – Deck of Cards

In this exercise we will build a simple rails app that simulates a deck of cards. We will focus on the backend for this project so don’t spend any time on the CSS or worry about how it looks. It’s not necessary to finish the entire exercise so please take your time to show your knowledge of rails and write some tests. There aren’t any trick questions or special tools we expect, just code follow basic rails best practice.

Requirements:

1.     Display a simple web page with 3 buttons: Draw, Show and Shuffle.
2.     The page should also have a section labelled “hand” to show which cards you currently have in your hand.
3.     When you click Draw, a card should be taken from the top of the deck and added to your hand.
4.     When you click Show, all cards left in the deck should move into your hand.
5.     When you click Shuffle, your hand should be cleared and the Deck reset in random order.
